# Commentary to accompany Text Complexity Code

I designed this to be my interview because I wanted to highlight how much my coding (in general, and in `scala` specifically) ability has improved since I first designed this project.  When I first built this system, I had only been coding in `scala` for less than six months.  It is now a year later, and so this entire system has been built with less than two years of experience with `scala` (and, frankly, only about three years of coding in any language).

As a means of introduction to this system, you can look [here](https://github.com/michaelcapizzi/Unbound/tree/master/src/main/scala/TextComplexity) for a detailed analysis of results from the first system.

##Main Advancements

I will highlight some of the main improvements that I was able to make to this system.  **Note:** While I have many ideas of how to improve the *performance* of the classifier itself, most of my improvement were more related to the engineering of the system than the features themselves, with one exception that is explained below.
